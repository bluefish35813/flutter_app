# flutter_app

This is a flutter application that I created using flutter in android studio. This application shows ways for any person to try to reduce climate change. It includes tips to help a person reduce their emissions as well as provides organizations to donate to that are fighting climate change. This app also has a calcuator to find the CO2 emissions from the car that is driven based on miles driven and miles per gallon of the car.
